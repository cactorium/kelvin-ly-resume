\section{Professional Experience}
\datedsubsection{Fluorometric Instruments Design Engineer, Orlando FL}{September 2017 - present}
\begin{flushleft}
I am working part time to \textbf{design PCBs} for oxygen sensors.
I worked on many of the stages of development for a handful of products, including \textbf{design, testing, parts sourcing, and assembly}.
The work involves designing PCBs to fit mechanical and electrical specifications, as well as \textbf{developing firmware and GUIs} for the devices as necessary.
\end{flushleft}
\datedsubsection{University of Central Florida Undergraduate/Graduate Researcher, Orlando Fl}
    {November 2015 - present}
\begin{flushleft}
The focus on my research here has been on the security of the \textbf{Internet of Things}, more specifically the development of defenses for IoT devices against attacks.
Consequently, much of my work so far has been in \textbf{PCB design and assembly} to develop devices to test out security ideas or provide education on hardware security, and software development to explore ideas in IoT security.
Designs so far have incorporated \textbf{MSP430} and \textbf{Atmel} microcontrollers, along with current work on a primitive \textbf{2.45 GHz radar system} for use in a labmate's project.
I have also previously worked on our submissions for the \textbf{NYU CSAW Embedded Security Competition} '15, '16, and '17 (winning second and first respectively, no win in 2017), which generally involved producing a proof of concept for solving some problem in \textbf{cryptography and security domains}.
These contests led to a wide range of challenges, from writing code to interface with \textbf{MATLAB Simulink} to \textbf{modifying the OpenRISC processor core} and \textbf{patching a GCC backend}.
I am currently being funded by an \textbf{SRC/Intel fellowship}.

\datedsubsection{University of Central Florida Undergraduate Researcher, Orlando FL}
	{December 2014 - March 2015}
\begin{flushleft}
We studied \textbf{feature extraction} from EEG data, focusing on \textbf{SSVEP frequency detection}, and used this knowledge in our senior design project, discussed further below.
We used emokit \textbf{Python} library to extract signals from Emotiv EEG headset.
Some work was done with the \textbf{RAVEN II} medical robot running software built on the \textbf{ROS robotics framework}.
\end{flushleft}
\section{Internships}
\datedsubsection{IBM Extreme Blue Intern, RTP NC}{May 2015 - August 2015}
\begin{flushleft}
Here our team worked on \textbf{on-disk encryption} for \textbf{IBM Connections}.
We pioneered work in this direction, producing a proof of concept to pave the way for the actual Connections team to develop.
We used \textbf{JavaScript and Node.js} for the server \textbf{backend}, and modified existing \textbf{Java} and \textbf{Python} code and libraries for various parts of the project.
% Our team was organized around modern programming practices, working in an \textbf{agile} team of four, with heavy emphasis on \textbf{test coverage} and \textbf{unit testing}.
\end{flushleft}
\datedsubsection{Google Software Engineer Intern, Chapel Hill NC}{May 2014 - August 2014}
\begin{flushleft}
I worked on the Skia benchmarking team, providing tooling for \textbf{Skia} rendering engine team.
This job involved pipelining the gigabytes of data being produced daily from test bots into a useful visualization for the Skia team.
I learned \textbf{Go}, and contributed code in \textbf{C++}, \textbf{Python}, and \textbf{Go} for both internal and open source projects.
