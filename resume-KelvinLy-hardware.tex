\section{Professional Experience}
\datedsubsection{University of Central Florida Undergraduate Researcher, Orlando FL}
	{December 2014 - current}
\begin{flushleft}
This research experience actually has had so far two major projects. The first
phase was focused on Working on a \textbf{RAVEN II} medical robot running the
\textbf{ROS C++} robotics framework. This robot was meant to work as surgery
robot, with our task being to augment the controls with BCI-based controls to
improve usability. Unfortunately the robot proved hard to use, and we switched
over to working in \textbf{signal processing} in \textbf{Python} of EEG data in
general. Our team has been studying \textbf{feature extraction} and
\textbf{SSVEP frequency detection} to hopefully advance the state of the art.
We have used \textbf{emokit} \textbf{Python} library to extract signals from
Emotiv EEG headset, and are continuing research into SSVEP BCI interfaces.

\section{Internships}
\datedsubsection{IBM Extreme Blue Intern, RTP NC}{May 2015 - August 2015}
\begin{flushleft}
Here our team worked on zero knowledge \textbf{encryption} for 
\textbf{IBM Connections Cloud}. We were the pioneering efforts at this, producing
a proof of concept to pave the way for the actual Connections team to develop.
We used \textbf{JavaScript and Node.js} for the server \textbf{backend}, and
modified and used existing \textbf{Java} and \textbf{Python} code and libraries
for various parts of the project. Our team was organized around modern programming
practices, working in an \textbf{agile} team of four, with heavy emphasis on
\textbf{test coverage} and \textbf{unit testing}.

\datedsubsection{Google Software Engineer Intern, Chapel Hill NC}{May 2014 - August 2014}
\begin{flushleft}
Here I worked as an intern on the Skia benchmarking team, worked on benchmarking
framework for \textbf{Skia} rendering engine team. I learned \textbf{Go}, and
contributed code in \textbf{C++}, \textbf{Python}, and \textbf{Go} for both
internal and open source projects. This job involved pipelining the gigabytes
of data being produced daily from test bots into a useful visualization for the
Skia team.
